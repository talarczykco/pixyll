<blockquote>All broken down by
The side of the road
<strong>I was never more alive or
Alone
I've worn the faces off
All the cards
I'm gonna take it with me
When I go</strong>
Children are playing
At the end of the day
Strangers are singing
On our lawn
It's got to be more
Than flesh and bone
All that you're loved
Is all you own
In a land there's a town
<strong>And in that town there's
A house
And in that house
There's a woman
And in that woman
There's a heart I love
I'm gonna take it
With me when I go</strong>
I'm gonna take it
With me when I go</blockquote>
