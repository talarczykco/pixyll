<blockquote>A disciple asked a learned Rabbi, not so very long ago, why it is that God used to speak directly to his people so often, yet he never does so now. The Rabbi, who was evidently a very wise man, replied, <strong>"Man cannot bend low enough now to hear what God says."</strong> That is exactly it. We shall only hear what God or the unconscious says by bending very low.
