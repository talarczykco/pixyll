<blockquote>"I believe if there's any kind of God it wouldn't be in any of us, not you or me but just this little space in between. <strong>If there's any kind of magic in this world it must be in the attempt of understanding someone sharing something.</strong> I know, it's almost impossible to succeed but who cares really? The answer must be in the attempt."
â€“ Celine, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Sunrise">Before Sunrise</a></blockquote>
