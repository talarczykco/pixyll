<blockquote>With haunted hearts through the heat and cold,
We never thought we could ever get old.
<strong>We thought we could sit forever in fun
But our chances really was a million to one.</strong>

As easy it was to tell black from white,
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
And our choices were few and the thought never hit
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split.

<strong>How many a year has passed and gone,
And many a gamble has been lost and won,
And many a road taken by many a friend,
And each one I've never seen again.</strong>

I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,
That we could sit simply in that room again.

I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.</del>
â€“Bob Dylan, "Bob Dylan's Dream"</blockquote>
