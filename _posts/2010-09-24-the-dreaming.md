<blockquote>"<strong>So we dream on. Thus we invent our lives.</strong> We give ourselves a sainted mother, we make our father a hero; and someone’s older brother and someone’s older sister – they become our heroes too. <strong>We invent what we love and what we fear.</strong> There is always a brave lost brother – and a little lost sister, too. <strong>We dream on and on</strong>: the best hotel, the perfect family, the resort life. And our dreams escape us almost as vividly as we can imagine them”¦ That’s what happens, like it or not." -<strong>John Irving</strong></blockquote>
