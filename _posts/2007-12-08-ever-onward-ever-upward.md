<blockquote>December 8, 2007

I miss you, John. 27 years later, I still wish I could turn back the clock to the Summer of 1980. I remember everything - sharing our morning coffee, walking in the park together on a beautiful day, and seeing your hand stretched to mine - holding it, reassuring me that I shouldn't worry about anything because our life was good.

...

<strong>Let's not waste the lives of those we have lost. Let's, together, make the world a place of love and joy and not a place of fear and anger. This day of John's passing has become more and more important for so many people around the world as the day to remember his message of Peace and Love and to do what each of us can to work on healing this planet we cherish.</strong>

Let's: Think Peace, Act Peace, and Spread Peace. John worked for it all his life. He said, <strong>"there's no problem, only solutions."</strong> Remember, we are all together. We can do it, we must. I love you!
