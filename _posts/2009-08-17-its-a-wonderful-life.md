<blockquote>
The first time I saw her
I couldn't be sure
But the sin of impatience
Said, <strong>"she's just what you're looking for"</strong>

So I walked right up to her
And <strong>with the part or me that talks 
I introduced myself as Frank
From New York New York</strong>
â€“Paul Simon, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004XQP0/ref=nosim/mijitcom">"Darling Lorraine"</a>
