<blockquote>I love the time
and inbetween
the calm inside me <strong>in the space
where I can breathe

I believe there is a distance
I have wandered to touch upon the years</strong> of
reaching out
and reaching in
holding out
holding in.

<strong>I believe
this is heaven
to no one else but me</strong>
and I'll defend it as long as
I can be
left here to linger
in silence
if I
choose to
<strong>would you
try to
understand?</strong>
â€“Sarah McLachlan <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002VT6/ref=nosim/mijitcom">"Elsewhere"</a></blockquote>
