<blockquote>"Say I am proud and sane and wise - an Athenian among Greeks. Well, I might fail where a lesser man would succeed. He could imitate, he could adorn, he could be enthusiastic, he could be hopefully constructive. But this hypothetical me would be <strong>too proud to imitate, too sane to be enthusiastic, too sophisticated to be utopian, too grecian to adorn.</strong>"
â€“ Anthony Patch in F. Scott Fitzgerald's, <a href="https://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/f/fitzgerald/f_scott/beaut/chapter2.html">"The Beautiful And The Damned"</a></blockquote>
