<blockquote>"Move within, <strong>but not the way that fear makes you move</strong>...

Keep walking though there's no place to get to,
Don't try to see through the distances - <strong>that's not for human beings to know..</strong>"

"Commit yourself to a daily practice,
your loyalty to that is a ring on the door.

<strong>Keep knocking</strong>
and eventually the joy
that lives inside
will look out to see
who's there!"
â€“Rumi</blockquote>
