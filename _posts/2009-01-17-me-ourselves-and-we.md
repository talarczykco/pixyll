The Buddha, which literally means "the awakened one," said <strong>"My form appeared like a dream to sentient beings who are like a dream. I taught them dreamlike teaching to attain dreamlike enlightenment."</strong> When we begin to awaken to the dreamlike nature of reality, we realize we are all characters in each other's dream. Like reflections in a mirror, we are all interconnected aspects of each other's being.

To recognize the dreamlike nature of our situation is to recognize that <strong>we don't exist as isolated entities separate from the universe, but rather as relational beings who only exist relative to each other.</strong> We are all related, parts of a greater family, the living multifaceted expression of a singular divine being. When we begin to awaken to the dreamlike nature of the universe <strong>we realize that the "dream ego," which is who we've been imagining we are, is only an un-reflected-upon and assumed model of who we are</strong> and is not who we really are, but is itself being dreamed by a deeper part of ourselves.

There is a deeper Self which is dreaming us. <strong>Like emanations of a meditating Buddha, we are the dream of something deeper, what I call the "deeper, dreaming Self," which is who we really are. There's only one deeper, dreaming Self and it is dreaming the whole universe.</strong> We are its dream. The deeper, dreaming Self expresses itself through and is not separate from the forms of the dream; <strong>we are simultaneously the dreamed and the dreamer.</strong> In the words of the German philosopher Schopenhauer, "one great dream of a single dreamer in which all the dream characters dream, too." The deeper, dreaming Self is having a dream, and we are it!
