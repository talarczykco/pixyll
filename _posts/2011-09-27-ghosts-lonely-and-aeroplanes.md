  <blockquote>"<strong>Dazed & Confused publisher Robert Montgomery</strong>, equipped with a poetic, subversive sense of humor, and inspired by the Situationist Movement of 1960s France, found a way to channel that frustration into public works of art. Drawing on the artistic tradition of détournement, Montgomery hijacks advertising space, turning billboards into poetic, abstract reflections and critiques on capitalism and the modern lifestyle. <strong>Turning a vehicle of mindless capitalism into something intellectually engaging and challenging? Seems like something we can get behind.</strong>"
