<blockquote>Now you're climbin' to the top of the company ladder
Hope it doesn't take too long
Cantcha you see there'll come a day when it wont matter
Come a day when you'll be gone

<strong>I understand about indecision
But I don't care if I get behind
People livin' in competition
All I want is to have my peace of mind.</strong>
