<blockquote>"<strong>When Rabbi Israel Baal Shem-Tov saw misfortune threatening,</strong> it was his custom to go into a certain part of the forest to meditate. There he would light a fire, say a special prayer, and the miracle would be accomplished and misfortune averted.

<strong>When his disciple, Magid of Mezritch,</strong> had occasion to intercede with heaven, he would go to the same place in the forest and say, <strong>"Master of the Universe, listen! I do not know how to light the fire, but I am still able to say the prayer.”</strong> Again, the miracle would be accomplished.

Later, Rabbi Moshe-Leib of Sasov, in order to save the people, would go into the forest and say, <strong>“I do not know how to light the fire. I do not know the prayer, but I know the place and this must be sufficient.”</strong>

Then it fell to Rabbi Israel of Rizhyn to overcome misfortune. Sitting in his armchair, head in his hands, he spoke to God: <strong>“I am unable to light the fire. I do not know the prayer. I cannot find the place in the forest. All I can do is tell the story, and this must be sufficient.”</strong>

<strong>And it was sufficient. God made man because He loves stories.</strong>"

-Eli Wiesel, from "The Gates of the Forest"</blockquote>
