<blockquote>Comes the morning
When I can feel
That <strong>there's nothing left to be concealed
Moving on a scene surreal</strong>
No, my heart will never
Will never be far from here

<strong>Sure as I am breathing
Sure as I'm sad
I'll keep this wisdom in my flesh
I leave here believing more than I had
And there's a reason I'll be
A reason I'll be back</strong>

As I walk
The Hemisphere
Got my wish
To up and disappear

<strong>I been wounded
I been healed</strong>
Now for landing I been
Landing I been cleared

Sure as I'm leaving
Sure as I'm sad
<strong>I'll keep this wisdom
In my flesh</strong>

I leave here believing
More than I had
<strong>This Love has got
No Ceiling</strong>
â€“Eddie Vedder</blockquote>
