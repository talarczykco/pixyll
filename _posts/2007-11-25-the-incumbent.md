<blockquote>New York, New York
I won't go back
Indelible reminder of the steel I lack
<strong>I gave you seven years
What did you give me back?
A jaw-grind, disposition to a panic attack</strong>
â€“Mike Doughty, of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002N56/ref=nosim/mijitcom">Soul Coughing</a></blockquote>
