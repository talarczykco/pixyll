<blockquote>
<strong>I</strong>
Among twenty snowy mountains,
The only moving thing
Was the eye of the blackbird.

<strong>II</strong>
I was of three minds,
Like a tree
In which there are three blackbirds.

<strong>III</strong>
The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.
<strong>It was a small part of the pantomime.</strong>

<strong>IV</strong>
A man and a woman
Are one.
A man and a woman and a blackbird
Are one.

<strong>V</strong>
<strong>I do not know which to prefer,
The beauty of inflections
Or the beauty of innuendoes,
The blackbird whistling
Or just after.</strong>
