<blockquote><strong>Chogyam Trungpa:</strong> Meditation practices have nothing to do with the value of the techniques as such, but are based on simplicity as a whole. They (students) shouldn't regard the technique as magical power at all. <strong>I should warn everybody that meditation has no magical power as such, but everybody has to work on themselves.</strong> Having used the technique diligently, from that point, people begin to develop. There is simplicity in the technique; they don't have to strive for it. The technique becomes part of themselves, (the) same as drinking a cup of tea, that becomes very close to it. So the technique should be referred to as part of the daily life situation, rather than medicine or a sedative as such.</blockquote>
