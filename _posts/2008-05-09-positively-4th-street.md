<blockquote>You got a lotta nerve
To say you are my friend
<strong>When I was down
You just stood there grinning</strong>

You got a lotta nerve
To say you got a helping hand to lend
<strong>You just want to be on
The side that's winning</strong>

You say I let you down
You know it's not like that
<strong>If you're so hurt
Why then don't you show it
</strong>
You say you lost your faith
But that's not where it's at
<strong>You had no faith to lose
And you know it</strong>

I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
<strong>I used to be among the crowd
You're in with</strong>

<strong>Do you take me for such a fool
To think I'd make contact
With the one who tries to hide
What he don't know to begin with</strong>

You see me on the street
You always act surprised
<strong>You say, "How are you?" "Good luck"
But you don't mean it</strong>

When you know as well as me
You'd rather see me paralyzed
<strong>Why don't you just come out once
And scream it

No, I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief
Perhaps I'd rob them

And now I know you're dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don't you understand
It's not my problem</strong>

<strong>I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes</strong>
And just for that one moment
I could be you

<strong>Yes, I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes</strong>
You'd know what a drag it is
To see you
