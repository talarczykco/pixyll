<blockquote>"When we must deal with problems, we instinctively resist trying the way that leads through obscurity and darkness. We wish to hear only of unequivocal results, and completely forget that these <strong>results can only be brought about when we have ventured into and emerged again from the darkness</strong>."
â€“<a href="https://philosophicalsociety.com/Archives/Carl%20Jung's%20Stages%20of%20Life.htm">C. G. Jung</a></blockquote>
