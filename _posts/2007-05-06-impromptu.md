<blockquote><strong>Keep away from sharp swords
Don't go near a lovely woman.</strong>
A sharp sword too close will wound your hand;
Woman's beauty too close will wound your life!
The danger of the road is not in the distance;
Ten yards is far enough to break a wheel.
<strong>The peril of love is not in loving too often;
A single evening can leave its wound in the soul.</strong>
â€“ Meng Chiao, eighth century CE</blockquote>
