<blockquote>Your cracked country lips,
I still wish to kiss,
As to be under the strength of your skin.
<strong>Your magnetic movements
Still capture the minutes I'm in.</strong>
But it grieves my heart, love,
To see you tryin' to be a part of
A world that just don't exist.
<strong>It's all just a dream, babe,
A vacuum, a scheme, babe,
That sucks you into feelin' like this.</strong>
â€“Bob Dylan, from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00026WUA0/ref=nosim/mijitcom">"To Ramona"</a></blockquote>
