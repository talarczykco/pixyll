<blockquote><strong>Mrs. Hooten:</strong> Albert, what brought you to the philosophical club?
<strong>Albert Markovski:</strong> You mean the existential detectives?
<strong>Mr. Hooten:</strong> Sounds like a support group.
<strong>Cricket:</strong> Why can't he use the church?
<strong>Mrs. Hooten:</strong> Sometimes, people have additional questions to be answered.
<strong>Cricket:</strong> Like what?
<strong>Albert Markovski: Well, um, for instance: if the forms of this world die, which is more real, the me that dies or the me that's infinite? Can I trust my habitual mind, or do I need to learn to look beneath those things?</strong>
