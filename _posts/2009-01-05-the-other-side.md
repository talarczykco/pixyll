<blockquote>'One day a young Buddhist on his journey home, came to the banks of a wide river. Staring hopelessly at the great obstacle in front of him, he pondered for hours on just how to cross such a wide barrier. Just as he was about to give up his pursuit to continue his journey he saw a great teacher on the other side of the river. The young Buddhist yells over to the teacher, <strong>"Oh wise one, can you tell me how to get to the other side of this river"?</strong>
The teacher ponders for a moment looks up and down the river and yells back, <strong>"My son, you are on the other side"</strong>.'
