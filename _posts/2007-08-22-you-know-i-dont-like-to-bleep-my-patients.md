<blockquote>"you know, like, your friends in california? they're... <strong>like</strong> your friends.  they kinda look like people, there's a telephone involved. they have an automobile. but, they're not like your friends back in new york. or boston.  or seattle. or atlanta. or texas. as a matter of fact, your friends in LA don't show up when they invite <strong>you</strong> somewhere. how do they make that work?"
