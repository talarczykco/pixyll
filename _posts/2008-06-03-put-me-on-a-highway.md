<blockquote>All alone at the end of the of the evening
And the bright lights have faded to blue
<strong>I was thinking ’bout a woman who might have
Loved me and I never knew</strong>
You know I’ve always been a dreamer
(spent my life running ’round)
And it’s so hard to change
(can’t seem to settle down)
<strong>But the dreams I’ve seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out
And turning out the same

So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time</strong>
–The Eagles, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002GVS/ref=nosim/mijitcom">"Take it to the Limit"</a></blockquote>
