<blockquote><strong>I am still living with your ghost
Lonely and dreaming of the west coast</strong>
I dont want to be your downtime
I dont want to be your stupid game

With my big black boots and an old suitcase
I do believe Ill find myself a new place
<strong>I dont want to be the bad guy
I dont want to do your sleepwalk dance anymore</strong>
I just want to see some palm trees
Go and try and shake away this disease

<strong>We can live beside the ocean
Leave the fire behind
Swim out past the breakers
Watch the world die
</strong></blockquote>
