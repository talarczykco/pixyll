<blockquote>Funny how lines of our favourite films come back. "Frankly my dear I don't give a dam" (Rhett's last line in GWTW - is one of my faves. But my all time favourite is the line in Zorba the Greek when the young Englishman, played by the late Alan Bates asks Zorba, Anthony Quinn, "Are you married?"

Zorba replies: <strong>"Am I not a man? And is not a man stupid? I’m a man. So I married. Wife, children, house, everything. The full catastrophe."</strong>

to this i would add:

<blockquote>
<strong>Basil</strong>: I don't want any trouble.
<strong>Alexis Zorba</strong>: Life is trouble. Only death is not. <strong>To be alive is to undo your belt and *look* for trouble.</strong>
</blockquote>
