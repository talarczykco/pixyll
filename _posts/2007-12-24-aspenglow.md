<blockquote>See the sunlight through the pine
Taste the warm of winter wine
Dream of softly falling snow
Winter skol, Aspenglow

As the winter days unfold
Hearts grow warmer with the cold
peace of mind is all you know
Winter skol, Aspenglow

Aspen is the life to live
See how much there is to give
See how strongly you believe
See how much you may receive

Smiling faces all around
laughter is the only sound
memories that can't grow old
Winter skol, Aspenglow

See the sunlight through the pine
Taste the warm of winter wine
Dream of softly falling snow
Winter skol, Aspenglow
Winter skol, Aspenglow </blockquote>
