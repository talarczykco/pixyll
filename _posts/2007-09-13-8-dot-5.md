stumbled upon in Stuart Sovatsky's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0892818301/ref=nosim/mijitcom">"Eros, Consciousness, and Kundalini"</a>:

<blockquote>Whoever you are holding me now in hand,
Without one thing all will be useless,
I give you fair warning before you attempt me further,
<strong>I am not what you supposed, but far different.</strong>

Who is he that would become my follower?
Who would sign himself a candidate for my affections?

The way is suspicious, the result uncertain, perhaps destructive,
You would have to give up all else, I alone would expect to be your
sole and exclusive standard,
Your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting, 
<strong>The whole past theory of your life and all conformity to the lives
around you would have to be abandon'd</strong>
...

Even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me, behold!
Already you see I have escaped from you.
...

â€“Walt Whitman, from <a href="https://bartleby.com/142/37.html">"Whoever You are, Holding Me now in Hand"</a></blockquote>
