<blockquote>"<strong>I thank my fate that I've been able to live my life free from filth and greed</strong>, to see my children grow and to look on as they first began to babble, to take hold of things, to walk, to play, to ask questions, to laugh and to love; <strong>that I've been able to preserve, in all its freedom and purity, my feeling for the springtime and its gentle breezes</strong>, for the gurgling of the brook that flows past my house and the singing of the birds in the woods; <strong>that I've taken no part in the gossip of malicious neighbors; that I've been happy in the embrace of my wife or husband and have felt the stream of life in my body</strong>; that I haven't lost my bearings in troubled times, and that my life has had meaning and continuity. For I have always hearkened to the gentle voice within me that said, <strong>'Only one thing matters: live a good, happy life. Do your heart's bidding, even when it leads you on paths that timid souls would avoid. Even when life is a torment, don't let it harden you.'</strong>"</blockquote>
Wilhelm Reich, from <a href="https://www.listenlittleman.com/">"Listen, Little Man!"</a>
