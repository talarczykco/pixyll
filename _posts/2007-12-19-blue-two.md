<blockquote>I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs,
<strong>There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air.</strong>
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died.
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside.
And when finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn,
<strong>The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew,
Tangled up in blue.</strong>
