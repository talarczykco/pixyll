<blockquote>In a busy, buzzing universe where no two snow flakes are identical, and no two trees are identical, and no two people are identical- and, indeed, the smallest sub-atomic particle, we are assured, is not even identical with itself from one microsecond to the next- every card-index system is a delusion. <strong>"Or, to put it more charitably,"</strong> as Nietzsche says, <strong>"we are all better artists than we realize."</strong>
â€“Robert Anton Wilson, in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1561840564/ref=nosim/mijitcom">Prometheus Rising</a></blockquote>
