<blockquote><strong>let it go</strong> – the
smashed word broken
open vow or
the oath cracked length
wise – <strong>let it go</strong> it
was sworn to
go

<strong>let them go</strong> – the
truthful liars and
the false fair friends
and the boths and
neithers – you must <strong>let them go</strong> they
were born
to go

<strong>let all go</strong> – the
big small middling
tall bigger really
the biggest and all
things – <strong>let all go</strong>
dear

<strong>so comes love</strong>

— e.e. cummings
