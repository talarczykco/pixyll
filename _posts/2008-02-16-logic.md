<blockquote><strong>As logic stands you couldn't meet a man
Who's from the future</strong>
But logic broke as he appeared he spoke
About the Future
"We're not gonna make it" He explained how
the end will come - you and me were never meant
to be part of the future -
All we have is now -
All we've ever had was now
<strong>All we have is now
All we'll ever have is now</strong>
â€“The Flaming Lips, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000068PQ0/ref=nosim/mijitcom">"All We Have is Now"</a></blockquote>
