<blockquote>I want to be your absolute ultimate
Want to be your only one now
<strong>Feel the wave come up from your sulkiness
Feel the rays you radiate now</strong>

Sweet and plain unsingable name
That rings in my mind now
That strums me like a string
Shine, unsingable name
Over everything

<strong>Beware the thrum of hearts in your presence</strong> and
Watch the breeze that snaps at you now
All the dogs that bark from the fences and
<strong>Everything is wanting for you</strong>
Smirk on the face and fists in the clenches and
Make the radiator blow now
Crack the planks and shatter the lenses and
Mix the salt, the sugar and flour
â€“From Mike Doughty's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00080EV7A/ref=nosim/mijitcom">"Unsingable Name"</a></blockquote>
