<blockquote>"So long as I breathe and have the strength to do it, I will not cease philosophizing, exhorting you, indicting whichever of you I happen to meet, telling him in my customary way: Esteemed friend, citizen of Athens, the greatest city in the world, so outstanding in both intelligence and power, aren't you ashamed to care so much to make all the money you can, and to advance your reputation and prestige – <strong>while for truth and wisdom and the improvement of your soul you have no care or worry?</strong>" –<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/069101938X/ref=nosim/mijitcom">Socrates</a></blockquote>
