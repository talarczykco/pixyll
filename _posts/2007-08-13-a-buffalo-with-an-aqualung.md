<blockquote>Quizmaster: Ha ha ha ... ha ha ha. Good evening, Madam! And your name is?
<strong>Mrs. Scum</strong>: Yes, yes.
<strong>Quizmaster</strong>: Ha ha ha! And what's your name?
<strong>Mrs. Scum</strong>: I go to church regularly.
<strong>Quizmaster</strong>: Jolly good, I see.  And which prize do you have particular eyes on this evening?
<strong>Mrs. Scum</strong>: <strong>Oh, I'd like the blow on the head.</strong>
<strong>Quizmaster</strong>: <strong>The blow â€“ on the head!</strong>
<strong>Mrs. Scum</strong>: Yes, just there.
<strong>Quizmaster</strong>: Jolly good!  Well, your first question for the blow the head this evening is: What great opponent of cartesian dualism resists the reduction of psychological phenomena to physical states?
<strong>Mrs. Scum</strong>: I don't know that!
<strong>Quizmaster</strong>: Well have a guess.
<strong>Mrs. Scum</strong>: Oh... er... Henri Bergson?
<strong>Quizmaster</strong>: ...is the correct answer!
<strong>Mrs. Scum</strong>: Oh, lucky, I never even heard of him.</blockquote>
