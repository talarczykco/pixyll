<blockquote><strong>"If you are not continuously striving toward an ever higher achievement or state of being</strong>, if you have nothing original to say or offer and are only good at repeating what someone else has said or created, if you are ‘proud’ that you can swim faster than others in the pond of mediocrity, or if you compare yourself only with those in your vicinity without ever striving to be the best in the world, then you are caught in the invisible web of conspiracy for mediocrity.

<strong>It is only through genuine romanticism and impassioned commitment to the highest possibility of the human soul</strong> that you can ascend beyond the heavy cloud of the conspiracy for mediocrity - that you can awaken from the mediocrity existing within and without by breaking the spell of the all-pervading conspiracy for mediocrity. <strong>And it is a hallmark of a great leader to enable others</strong> to lead romantic and impassioned lives toward self-realization through character development."
–from <a href="https://www.pattern.com/kimura-moses.html">"The Portrait of Moses"</a>, by Yasuhiko Genku Kimura</blockquote>
