<blockquote>Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair.
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns.
<strong>"Come in," she said,
"I'll give you shelter from the storm."</strong>

<strong>Now there's a wall between us, somethin' there's been lost
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed.
Just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn.</strong>
"Come in," she said,
"I'll give you shelter from the storm."
â€“ Bob Dylan, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000253N/ref=nosim/mijitcom">"Shelter From the Storm"</a></blockquote>
