<blockquote>We were talking - about the space between us all
And the people - who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse of truth - then it's far too late - when they pass away
We were talking - about the love we could all share - when we find it
To try our best to hold it there - with our love
With our love - We could save the world - if they only knew
<strong>Try to realise it's all within yourself no-one else can make you change</strong>
And to see you're really only very small, and life flows on
wit-hin and wit-hout you
We were talking - about the love that's gone so cold and the people,
Who gain the world and lose their soul - then you may find,
pea-ce of mind, is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one, and life flows on within and without you
