> **What we are trying, during all these discussions and talks here,
> is to see if we cannot radically bring about a transformation of the mind
> &mdash; not accept things as they are.** But to understand it, to go
> into it, to examine it, give your heart and your mind, with everything that
> you have, to find out a way of living differently.
> 
> But, that depends on you, and not on somebody else. **Because in this there
> is no teacher, no pupil; there is no leader; there is no guru; there is no
> Master, no Saviour. You yourself are the teacher and the pupil; you are the
> Master; you are the guru; you are the leader; you are everything.**
> And, to understand is to transform what is.‚Äù &mdash; [Jiddu Krishnamurti](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/256015-you-know-if-we-understand-one-question-rightly-all-questions)
