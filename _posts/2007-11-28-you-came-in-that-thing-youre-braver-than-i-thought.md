<blockquote><strong>Stanislav Grof’s four perinatal matrices</strong> provide a useful guide to why certain types of imagery appear in the Star Wars trilogy and to the dynamics of the struggle between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.  The human struggle to be born imprints experiences upon the neonate so strongly that they influence the nature of postnatal imagination and behavior.  That primal struggle tends to be constantly relived throughout our lives.  So when films such as Star Wars project imagery evocative of that struggle, they mirror and evoke memories powerfully present in the unconscious.  The opportunity to vicariously relive those experiences is part of the attraction of the trilogy, contributing to its unparalleled worldwide appeal.
