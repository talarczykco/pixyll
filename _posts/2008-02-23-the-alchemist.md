<blockquote><strong>"My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer,"</strong> the boy confides to the alchemist one night as they look up at a moonless night. <strong>"Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself,"</strong> the alchemist replies. "And that <strong>no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams</strong>, because every second of the search is a second's encounter with God and with eternity."
â€“Paraphrased from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061122416/ref=nosim/mijitcom">"The Alchemist"</a></blockquote>
