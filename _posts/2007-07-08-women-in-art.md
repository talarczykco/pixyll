<blockquote> Ignorant, in the sense
she ate monotonous food
and thought the world was flat,
and pagan, in the sense
she knew the things that moved
all night were neither dogs or cats
but hobgoblin and darkfaced men
she nevertheless had fierce pride.
But sentenced in the end
to eat thin diminishing porridge
in a stone-cold kitchen
she clenched her brittle hands
around a world
she could not understand.
I loved her from the day she died.

She was a summer dance at the crossroads.
She was a cardgame where a nose was broken.
She was a song that nobody sings.
She was a house ransacked by soldiers.
She was a language seldom spoken.
She was a child's purse, full of useless things.

â€“"Death of an Irishwoman" by <a href="https://www.irishcultureandcustoms.com/Poetry/Hartnett.html">Michael Hartnett</a></blockquote>

[ed: this poem has not much to do with the musical piece, i was just reading it around the same time.]
