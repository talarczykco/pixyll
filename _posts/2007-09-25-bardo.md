<blockquote>Sentient beings are numberless: I vow to liberate them. 
<strong>Delusions are inexhaustible: I vow to transcend them.</strong>
Dharma teachings are boundless: I vow to master them. 
The Buddha's enlightened way is unsurpassable: I vow to embody it.
â€“Consecration by Lama Tutop </blockquote>
