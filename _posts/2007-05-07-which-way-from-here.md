<blockquote>"But I don't want to go among mad people," Alice remarked.
"Oh, you can't help that," said the Cat: "we're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad."
<strong>"How do you know I'm mad?"</strong> said Alice.
<strong>"You must be,"</strong> said the Cat, <strong>"or you wouldn't have come here."</strong>
â€“Lewis Carroll, from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"</blockquote>
