<blockquote>Hello, how are you?
Have you been alright,
Through all the lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely nights,
That's what I'd say, I'd tell you everything,
If you'd pick up that telephone

Hey, how you feelin'?
Are you still the same?
<strong>Don't you realise the things we did, we did,
Were all for real not a dream,</strong>
I just can't believe,
They've all faded out of view
â€“ELO, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000025HO/ref=nosim/mijitcom">"Telephone Line"</a></blockquote>
