<blockquote><strong>Sarvam annam, everything is food.</strong> We feed not only on vegetarian or non-vegetarian food, but on all sound and visual vibrations, on all kinds of impressions: architectural proportions, union of forms and colors, harmonies and rhythms of music, and all the ideas with which we come in contact. All this, absorbed mechanically and without real attention throughout the day, has made up our being and continues to do so.
â€“From Roberto Assagioli's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140038663/ref=nosim/mijitcom">"The Act of Will"</a></blockquote>
