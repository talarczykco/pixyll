<blockquote>25. Aedh tells of the perfect Beauty

<strong>O CLOUD-PALE eyelids</strong>, dream-dimmed eyes
The poets labouring all their days	 
To build a perfect beauty in rhyme	 
Are overthrown by a woman’s gaze	 
And by the unlabouring brood of the skies:
And therefore my heart will bow, when dew	 
Is dropping sleep, until God burn time,	 
Before the unlabouring stars and you.

–William Butler Yeats</blockquote>
