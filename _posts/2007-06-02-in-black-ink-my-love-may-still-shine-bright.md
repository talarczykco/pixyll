<blockquote>Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,
But sad mortality o'er-sways their power,
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out
Against the wreckful siege of battering days,
When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
Nor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?
<strong>O fearful meditation! where, alack,
Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?</strong>
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
O, none, unless this miracle have might,
That <strong>in black ink my love may still shine bright</strong>.
â€“Shakespeare's <a href="https://www.shakespeare-online.com/sonnets/65detail.html">Sonnet 65</a></blockquote>
