<blockquote>"Once again internet radio is facing huge additional royalties for broadcasting music. These royalties are in addition to the ones that already paid to ASCAP and BMI, and are a royalty that is only paid by internet broadcasters. <strong>Over-the-air (AM/FM) broadcasters are explicitly exempt from this royalty;</strong> it only applies to internet broadcasters and subscription music services."</blockquote>
