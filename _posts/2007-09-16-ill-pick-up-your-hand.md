<blockquote>Sunshine came softly through my a-window today
Could've tripped out easy a-but I've a-changed my ways
<strong>It'll take time, I know it but in a while
You're gonna be mine, I know it, we'll do it in style</strong>
'Cause I made my mind up you're going to be mine

â€“Donovan, "Sunshine Superman"</blockquote>
