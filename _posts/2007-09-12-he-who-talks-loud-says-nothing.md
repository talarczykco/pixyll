googled via the "noodling" <a href="https://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000005J5D/ref=nosim/mijitcom">dead man soundtrack</a> by neil young:

<blockquote>Always be ready to speak your mind, and a base man will avoid you.
Every thing possible to be believ'd is an image of truth.
<strong>The eagle never lost so much time as when he submitted to learn of the crow.</strong>
The fox provides for himself, but God provides for the lion.
Think in the morning. Act in the noon. Eat in the evening. Sleep in the night.
He who has suffer'd you to impose on him, knows you.
As the plow follows words, so God rewards prayers.
<strong>The tygers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction.</strong>
â€“William Blake, from <a href="https://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192811673/ref=nosim/mijitcom">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</a></blockquote>
