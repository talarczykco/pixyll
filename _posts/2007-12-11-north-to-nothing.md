<blockquote>i took to faces shooting stills and places
i took nudes of our youngest boy
<strong>I took two years to take his name over</strong>
i beat blank with blank's toy

i'd sing your praises to the devil's face
but even fire couldn't dry you out
<strong>you wouldn't know a good shot if you drank one</strong>
Then throws up throws punches throws everybody out

<strong>shut up and while we're on the subject
of endless me and the what's i've done
i didn't raise my boy to be your snapshot toy
not for you, not my son</strong>

And as he made his point, he opened up my eye:
We're off and running
<strong>North to Nothing, yeah
I would not miss him
as perfect as he ****</strong>
