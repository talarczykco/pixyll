<blockquote><strong>"In the province of the mind what one believes to be true, either </strong><strong>is</strong> true or becomes true within certain limits. These limits are to be found experimentally and experientially. <strong>When so found these limits turn out to be further beliefs to be transcended. In the province of the mind there are no limits."
â€“ <a href="https://www.intuition.org/txt/lilly.htm">John C. Lilly</a></strong></blockquote>
