<blockquote><strong>A smile relieves a heart that grieves
Remember what I said</strong>
I'm not waiting on a lady
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend

<strong>Don't need a whore
I don't need no booze</strong>
Don't need a virgin priest
<strong>But I need someone I can cry to
I need someone to protect
</strong>Making love and breaking hearts
It is a game for youth
<strong>But I'm not waiting on a lady
I'm just waiting on a friend</strong>
â€“Rolling Stones, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000000W5F/ref=nosim/mijitcom">"Waiting On A Friend"</a></blockquote>
