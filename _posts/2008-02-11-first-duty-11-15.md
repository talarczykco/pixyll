<blockquote><strong>11:</strong> <strong>"I do not know whether behind appearances there lives and moves a secret essence superior to me. Nor do I ask; I do not care.</strong> I create phenomena in swarms, and paint with a full palette a gigantic and gaudy curtain before the abyss. <strong>Do not say, 'Draw the curtain that I may see the painting.' The curtain is the painting.</strong>
<strong>12:</strong> "This kingdom is my child, a transitory, a human work. But it's a solid work, nothing more solid exists, and only within its boundaries can I remain fruitful, happy, and at work.
<strong>13:</strong> <strong>"I am the worker of the abyss. I am the spectator of the abyss. I am both theory and practice. I am the law. Nothing beyond me exists."</strong>
<strong>14:</strong> To SEE and accept the boundaries of the human mind without vain rebellion, and in these severe limitations to work ceaselessly without protest - this is where man's first duty lies.
<strong>15:</strong> <strong>Build over the unsteady abyss, with manliness and austerity, the fully round and luminous arena of the mind where you may thresh and winnow the universe like a lord of the land.</strong>
–Nikos Kazantzakis, from <a href="https://www.angel.net/~nic/askitiki.html">“The Saviors of God”</a></blockquote>
