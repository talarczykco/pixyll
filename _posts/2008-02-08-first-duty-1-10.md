<blockquote>
   <strong>1.</strong> WITH CLARITY and quiet, I look upon the world and say: <strong>All that I see, hear, taste, smell, and touch are the creations of my mind.</strong>
   <strong>2.</strong> The sun comes up and the sun goes down in my skull. Out of one of my temples the sun rises, and into the other the sun sets.
   <strong>3.</strong> The stars shine in my brain; ideas, men, animals browse in my temporal head; songs and weeping fill the twisted shells of my ears and storm the air for a moment.
   <strong>4.</strong> My brain blots out, and all, the heavens and the earth, vanish.
   <strong>5.</strong> The mind shouts: "Only I exist!
   <strong>6.</strong> "Deep in my subterranean cells my five senses labor; they weave and unweave space and time, joy and sorrow, matter and spirit.
   <strong>7.</strong> <strong>"All swirl about me like a river, dancing and whirling; faces tumble like water, and chaos howls.</strong>
   <strong>8.</strong> "<strong>But I, the Mind, continue to ascend patiently, manfully, sober in the vertigo.</strong> That I may not stumble and fall, I erect landmarks over this vertigo; I sling bridges, open roads, and build over the abyss.
   <strong>9.</strong> "Struggling slowly, I move among the phenomena which I create, I distinguish between them for my convenience, I unite them with laws, I yoke them to my heavy practical needs.
  <strong>10.</strong> <strong>"I impose order on disorder and give a face - my face - to chaos.</strong>
â€“Nikos Kazantzakis, from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671202324/ref=nosim/mijitcom">"The Saviors of God"</a></blockquote>
