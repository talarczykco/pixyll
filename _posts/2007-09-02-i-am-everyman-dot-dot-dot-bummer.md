<blockquote>"We're designed to be hunters and we're in a society of shopping.  <strong>There's nothing to kill anymore, there's nothing to fight, nothing to overcome, nothing to explore.  In that societal emasculation this everyman is created.</strong>"  ~<a href="https://www.quotegarden.com/bk-fc.html">David Fincher</a>, director of Fight Club, interview with Gavin Smith, "Inside Out," Film Comment, Sep/Oct 1999</blockquote>
