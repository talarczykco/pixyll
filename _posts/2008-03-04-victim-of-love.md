<blockquote><strong>What kind of love have you got?
You should be home, but you're not
A room full of noise and dangerous boys
still makes you thirsty and hot</strong>
I heard about you and that man
There's just one thing I don't understand
You say he's a liar and he put out your fire
How come you still got his gun in your hand?
Victim of love, I see a broken heart
You got your stories to tell
Victim of love, it's such an easy part
and you know how to play it so well

<strong>Some people never come clean
I think you know what I mean
You're walkin' the wire, pain and desire
Looking for love in between</strong>
