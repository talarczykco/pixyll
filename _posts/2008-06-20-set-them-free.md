<blockquote><strong>If you need somebody, call my name
If you want someone, you can do the same
</strong>If you want to keep something precious
You got to lock it up and throw away the key
If you want to hold onto your possession
Don't even think about me

<strong>If you love somebody, set them free</strong>

If it's a mirror you want, just look into my eyes
Or a whipping boy, someone to despise
Or a prisoner in the dark
Tied up in chains you just can't see
Or <strong>a beast in a gilded cage
That's all some people ever want to be</strong>

â€“Sting, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002GFA/ref=nosim/mijitcom">"If You Love Somebody Set Them Free"</a></blockquote>
