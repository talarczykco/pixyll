<blockquote>I couldn't see when it started snowin'
Your voice was all that I heard
I couldn't see where we were goin'
But you said you knew an' I took your word
And then you told me later, as I apologized
That you were just kiddin' me, you weren't really from the farm
An' I told you, as you clawed out my eyes
That I never really meant to do you any harm

<strong>But, sooner or later, one of us must know
You just did what you're supposed to do
Sooner or later, one of us must know
That I really did try to get close to you</strong>
â€“Bob Dylan, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000024OG/ref=nosim/mijitcom">"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)"</a></blockquote>
