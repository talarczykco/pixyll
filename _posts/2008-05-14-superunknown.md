<blockquote>Whatsoever I've feared has
Come to life
<strong>Whatsoever I've fought off
Became my life</strong>
Just when everyday
Seemed to greet
Me with a smile
Sunspots have faded
And now I'm doing time
Cause I fell on
Black days

Whomsoever I've cured
I've sickened now
<strong>Whomsoever I've cradled
I've put you down</strong>
I'm a search light soul
They say but I can't
See it in the night
I'm only faking
When I get it right
Cause I fell on
Black days
<strong>How would I know
That this could be my fate</strong>
