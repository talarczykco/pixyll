<blockquote><strong>Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the angels'
hierarchies?</strong> and even if one of them suddenly                                                       
pressed me against his heart, I would perish
in the embrace of his stronger existence.                                                           
For <strong>beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror
which we are barely able to endure and are awed                                                     
because it serenely disdains to annihilate us.</strong>
Each single angel is terrifying.                                                                    
And so I force myself, swallow and hold back
the surging call of my dark sobbing.                                                                
Oh, to whom can we turn for help?
Not angels, not humans;
and even the knowing animals are aware that we feel
little secure and at home in our interpreted world.

â€“ Rainer Maria Rilke</blockquote>
