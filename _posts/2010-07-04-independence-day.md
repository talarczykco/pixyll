<blockquote>Only daughter
You got your ticket too soon
Holy water
'Cause everybody's getting ruined
They are waiting to see what you do
Too long, waiting
Everybody's cleared the room

<strong>
And they'll dress you up
Stand you in all the right places
Words like honey
They smile as they change your faces
With no regard to you at all
And you find they treat you like a paper doll

And they'll dress you up for the flight
Like Ophelia, you wave goodnight
With the earth and sky you cheer and sigh
Writhe as all your days go by
And laugh as you die
</strong>

Sweet softer shoulder, oh sweet sugar safe
Sweet softer shoulder, oh sweet sugar safe

Everybody's got their own philosophy
And I can't wait 'til I
Find one coming to me
Oh, the bridge is narrow
You better not look down
'Cause as soon as you jump over
You won't find nobody around
<strong>Oh, the bridge is narrow
And you've got so far to fall
And you know down in dirty water's
No place for a paper doll
</strong>
â€“Rachael Yamagata, "Paper Doll"</blockquote>
