<blockquote>
There comes a time in life
To put on your coat and go outside
To taste the vinegar of life, bitter life
<strong>To taste a second time, its sweet surprise
Sweet surprise</strong>

<strong>It's not that hard to figure it out
When there's no question, there's no doubt</strong>
I burned an effigy to time, senseless time
To view the miracle, but the water isn't wine
And that was my crime

<strong>There is a face in the stone
We let it out to find its form</strong>
To shape the testament of will, strongest will
Pride, humility, a bitter pill
Bitter pill

Sweet surrender, oh my Lord
I never thought I'd see
Not surprising, still I find
<strong>I'm shaking, crying
But I'm laughing, softly</strong>

<strong>There comes a time in life
To put on your coat and go outside</strong>
