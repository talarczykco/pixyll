<blockquote>Two by two and side by side
Love's gonna find you yes it is
You just can't hide
You'll hear it call
Your heart will fall
Then love will fly
It's gonna soar
I don't care for any casanova thing
All I can say is
Love stinks

<strong>I've been through diamonds
I've been through minks
I've been through it all
Love stinks</strong>
â€“ J. Geils Band <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000DRA8/ref=nosim/mijitcom">"Love Stinks"</a></blockquote>
