<blockquote><div style="width: 300px; align: left; text-align: center; margin-top: 1em;">
Where does the real poetry
Come from?

From the amorous sighs
In this moist dark when making love
With form or
Spirit.

Where does poetry live?

In the eye that says,"Wow wee,"
In the overpowering felt splendor
Every sane mind knows
When it realizes - our life dance
Is only for a few magic
Seconds,

From the heart saying,
Shouting,
 
<strong>"I am so damn
Alive."</strong>
