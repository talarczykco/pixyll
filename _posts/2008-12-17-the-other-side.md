<blockquote><strong>Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing,
there is a field. I'll meet you there.</strong>

When the soul lies down in that grass,
the world is too full to talk about.
<strong>Ideas, language, even the phrase "each other" doesn't make any sense.</strong>
â€“ mevlana jelaluddin rumi - 13th century</blockquote>
