<blockquote><ol start="16">
	<li><strong>Distinguish clearly these bitter yet fertile human truths, flesh of our flesh, and admit them heroically:</strong> (a) the mind of man can perceive appearances only, and never the essence of things; (b) and not all appearances but only the appearances of matter; (c) and more narrowly still: not even these appearances of matter, but only relationships between them; (d) and these relationships are not real and independent of man, for even these are his creations; (e) and they are not the only ones humanly possible, but simply the most convenient for his practical and perceptive needs.</li>

	<li><strong>Within these limitations the mind is the legal and absolute monarch. No other power reigns within its kingdom.</strong></li>

	<li>I recognize these limitations, I accept them with resignation, bravery, and love, and I struggle at ease in their closure, as though I were free.</li>

	<li><strong>I subdue matter and force it to become my mind's good medium.</strong> I rejoice in plants, in animals, in man and in gods, as though they were my children. I feel all the universe nestling about me and following me as though it were my own body.</li>

	<li><strong>In sudden dreadful moments a thought flashes through me: "This is all a cruel and futile game, without beginning, without end, without meaning." But again I yoke myself swiftly to the wheels of necessity, and all the universe begins to revolve around me once more.</strong></li>

	<li><strong>Discipline is the highest of all virtues.</strong> Only so may strength and desire be counterbalanced and the endeavors of man bear fruit.</li>

	<li>This is how, with clarity and austerity, you may determine the omnipotence of the mind amid appearances and the incapacity of the mind beyond appearances - before you set out for salvation. You may not otherwise be saved.</li>

-–Nikos Kazantzakis, from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671202324/ref=nosim/mijitcom">“The Saviors of God”</a>
