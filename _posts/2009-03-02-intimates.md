<blockquote><strong>Don't you care for my love?</strong> she said bitterly.

I handed her the mirror, and said:
<strong>Please address these questions to the proper person!
Please make all requests to headquarters!
In all matters of emotional importance
please approach the supreme authority direct!</strong> -
So I handed her the mirror.

And she would have broken it over my head,
but she caught a sight of her own reflection
and that held her spellbound for two seconds
while I fled.
â€“D.H. Lawrence</blockquote>
