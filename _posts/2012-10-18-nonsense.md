<blockquote><strong>I do not consider myself less ignorant than most people. I have been and still am a seeker, but I have ceased to question stars and books; I have begun to listen to the teachings my blood whispers to me. My story is not a pleasant one; it is neither sweet nor harmonious, as invented stories are; it has the taste of nonsense and chaos, of madness and dreams â€” like the lives of all men who stop deceiving themselves.</strong>
-Herman Hesse, prologue to Demian</blockquote>
