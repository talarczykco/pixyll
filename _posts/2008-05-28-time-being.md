His disciples said to him: On what day will the kingdom come? [jesus said:] It will not come while people watch for it; they will not say: Look, here it is, or: Look, there it is; but <strong>the kingdom of the father is spread out over the earth, and men do not see it.</strong> –<a href="https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/thomas/gospelthomas113.html">Gospel of Thomas Saying 113</a>

"<strong>Real poetry</strong> doesn't say anything, it <strong>just ticks off the possibilities.</strong>" –<a href="https://www.doors.com/miami/redux.html">Jim Morrison</a>
