–Pablo Picasso

<blockquote>I

The man bent over his guitar,
A shearsman of sorts. The day was green.

They said, <strong>"You have a blue guitar,
You do not play things as they are."</strong>

The man replied, <strong>"Things as they are 
Are changed upon the blue guitar."</strong>

And they said then, "But play, you must,
A tune beyond us, yet ourselves,

A tune upon the blue guitar
Of things exactly as they are."
