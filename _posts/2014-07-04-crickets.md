<blockquote>Once upon a time, there was a Zen student who quoted an old Buddhist poem to his teacher, which says:

"The voices of torrents are from one great tongue, the lions of the hills are the pure body of Buddha. 'Isn't that right?' he said to the teacher. <strong>'It is,'</strong> said the teacher, <strong>'but it's a pity to say so.'</strong>"
</blockquote>

Or, so says Alan Watts, in his <a href="https://www.alanwatts.org/2-3-5-zen-bones/" title="Lecture on Zen">Lecture on Zen</a>.
