<blockquote>"Perhaps <strong>truth by its nature makes communication between people impossible</strong>, in any case, communication by the intermediary of words. Everyone may know it for himself, but <strong>in order to enter into relations with his fellow men he must renounce truth and adopt any conventional lie</strong>."
â€“Leo Shestov, <a href="https://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0836908767/ref=nosim/mijitcom">Penultimate Words</a></blockquote>
