<blockquote><strong>If Michael, leader of God's host
When Heaven and Hell are met,
Looked down on you from Heaven's door-post
He would his deeds forget.</strong>

Brooding no more upon God's wars
In his divine homestead,
He would go weave out of the stars
A chaplet for your head.
	 
And all folk seeing him bow down,
And white stars tell your praise,
Would come at last to God's great town,
Led on by gentle ways;
	 
<strong>And God would bid His warfare cease,
Saying all things were well;
And softly make a rosy peace,
A peace of Heaven with Hell.</strong>
