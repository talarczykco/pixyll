<blockquote><strong>How to fight loneliness
Smile all the time
Shine your teeth 'til meaningless
Sharpen them with lies</strong>

And whatever's going down
Will follow you around
That's how you fight loneliness
You laugh at every joke
Drag your blanket blindly
Fill your heart with smoke
And the first thing that you want
Will be the last thing you ever need
Thats how you fight it

Just smile all the time
Just smile all the time
Just smile all the time
Just smile all the time
