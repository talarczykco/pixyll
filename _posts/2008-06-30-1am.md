<blockquote>Once I used to believe
I was such a great romancer
Then I came home to a woman
That I could not recognize
When I pressed her for a reason
She refused to even answer
<strong>It was then I felt the stranger
Kick me right between the eyes</strong>

Well we all fall in love
But we disregard the danger
Though we share so many secrets
There are some we never tell
Why were you so surprised
That you never saw the stranger
<strong>Did you ever let your lover see
The stranger in yourself?</strong>

Don't be afraid to try again
Everyone goes south
Every now and then
You've done it why can't
Someone else?
<strong>You should know by now
You've been there yourself</strong>

You may never understand
How the stranger is inspired
But he isn't always evil
And he is not always wrong
Though you drown in good intentions
You will never quench the fire
You'll give in to your desire
When the stranger comes along.
â€“Billy Joel, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000DCHC/ref=nosim/mijitcom">"The Stranger"</a></blockquote>
