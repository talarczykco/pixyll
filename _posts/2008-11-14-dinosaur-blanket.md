<blockquote><strong>Buckets of rain
Buckets of tears</strong>
Got all them buckets comin' out of my ears.
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
I got all the love, honey baby,
You can stand.

I been meek
And hard like an oak
<strong>I seen pretty people disappear like smoke.
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear,</strong>
If you want me, honey baby,
I'll be here.

Like your smile
And your fingertips
Like the way that you move your lips.
I like the cool way you look at me,
<strong>Everything about you is bringing me
Misery.</strong>

<strong>Little red wagon
Little red bike
I ain't no monkey but I know what I like.</strong>
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
I'm takin' you with me, honey baby,
When I go.

<strong>Life is sad
Life is a bust
All ya can do is do what you must.
You do what you must do and ya do it well,</strong>
I'll do it for you, honey baby,
Can't you tell?</blockquote>
