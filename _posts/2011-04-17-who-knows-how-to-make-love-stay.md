<blockquote>"<strong>Tell love you are going to the Junior's Deli on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn to pick up a cheesecake,</strong> and if love stays, it can have half. <strong>It will stay.</strong>

<strong>Tell love you want a momento of it and obtain a lock of its hair.</strong> Burn the hair in a dime-store incense burner with yin/yang symbols on three sides. Face southwest. Talk fast over the burning hair in a convincingly exotic language. Remove the ashes of the burnt hair and use them to paint a mustache on your face. <strong>Find love. Tell it you are someone new. It will stay.</strong>

<strong>Wake love up in the middle of the night. Tell it the world is on fire.</strong> Dash to the bedroom window and pee out of it. Casually return to bed and assure love that everything is going to be all right. <strong>Fall asleep. Love will be there in the morning.</strong>”
–Tom Robbins, from "Still Life With Woodpecker"</blockquote>
