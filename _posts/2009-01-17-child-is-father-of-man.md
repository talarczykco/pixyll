<blockquote>MY heart leaps up when I behold
  A rainbow in the sky:
<strong>So was it when my life began,
  So is it now I am a man,
So be it when I shall grow old
    Or let me die!</strong>
The child is father of the man:
And I could wish my days to be
Bound each to each by natural piety.
â€“W. Wordsworth</blockquote>
