this poem quite possibly defined my writing style:

<blockquote><strong>I am not a painter, I am a poet.</strong>
Why? I think I would rather be
a painter, but I am not. <strong>Well,</strong>

for instance, <strong>Mike Goldberg
is starting a painting.</strong> I drop in.
"Sit down and have a drink" he
says. I drink; we drink. I look
up. "You have SARDINES in it."
"Yes, it needed something there."
"Oh." <strong>I go and the days go by
and I drop in again. The painting
is going on, and I go, and the days
go by. I drop in.</strong> The painting is
finished. "Where's SARDINES?"
All that's left is just
letters, "It was too much," Mike says.

But me? One day I am thinking of
a color: <strong>orange</strong>. I write a line
about orange. Pretty soon it is a
whole page of words, not lines.
Then another page. <strong>There should be
so much more, not of orange, of
words, of how terrible orange is
and life.</strong> Days go by. It is even in
prose, I am a real poet. My poem
is finished and I haven't mentioned
orange yet. It's twelve poems, I call
it ORANGES. And one day in a gallery
I see Mike's painting, called <strong>SARDINES</strong>.
