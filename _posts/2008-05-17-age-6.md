i drew this at age six after my father took me to work at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Company">digital equipment corp</a> in the 70's. it was probably the first time i touched a "computer" (this being but a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal">terminal</a>).

this was an LA-100, which printed dot-matrix output on continuous sheet-fed printer paper. i remember coming home with stacks of output on which i had played games like "hangman" and "chase", poring over my every move in retrospect.

most likely this machine was connected to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11">PDP-11</a> but the details are hazy...  in that era, the machines were in another room, a "terminal" being, essentially, one end of a long keyboard/video cable.

note the phone attached to the terminal via an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_coupler">acoustic coupler</a>. damn, i am old school.
