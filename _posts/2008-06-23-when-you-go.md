<blockquote>I've seen love go by my door
It's never been this close before
Never been so easy or so slow.
<strong>Been shooting in the dark too long
When somethin's not right it's wrong
Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.</strong>

<strong>Dragon clouds so high above
I've only known careless love,
It's always hit me from below.</strong>
This time around it's more correct
Right on target, so direct,
Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.

Purple clover, Queen Anne lace,
Crimson hair across your face,
<strong>You could make me cry if you don't know.
Can't remember what I was thinkin' of
You might be spoilin' me too much, love,
Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.</strong>

Flowers on the hillside, bloomin' crazy,
Crickets talkin' back and forth in rhyme,
<strong>Blue river runnin' slow and lazy,
I could stay with you forever
And never realize the time.

Situations have ended sad,
Relationships have all been bad.
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud.</strong>
But there's no way I can compare
All those scenes to this affair,
Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.

Yer gonna make me wonder what I'm doin',
Stayin' far behind without you.
<strong>Yer gonna make me wonder what I'm sayin',
Yer gonna make me give myself a good talkin' to.</strong>

<strong>I'll look for you in old Honolulu,
San Francisco, Ashtabula,
Yer gonna have to leave me now, I know.
But I'll see you in the sky above,
In the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.</strong>
