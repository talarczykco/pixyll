<blockquote>Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
<strong>To understand you know too soon
There is no sense in trying.</strong>

Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fool's gold mouthpiece
The hollow horn plays wasted words
Proves to warn
<strong>That he not busy being born
Is busy dying.</strong>

Temptation's page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
<strong>You feel to moan but unlike before
You discover
That you'd just be
One more person crying.</strong>

<strong>So don't fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing.</strong>

â€“ Bob Dylan, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00026WU9Q/ref=nosim/mijitcom">"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)"</a></blockquote>
