<blockquote>And I wonder
When I sing along with you
<strong>If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again</strong>
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
â€“ Everlong, by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002UKS/ref=nosim/mijitcom">Foo Fighters</a></blockquote>
